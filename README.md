Phantasma Labs simChallenge: modelling of a pedestrian simulator
The task is explained the pdf file 'task.pdf'
The detailed description of the approach taken in explained the pdf file 'Report_Tripathi.pdf'
To run the simulation:
  1. clone the repository and do not change the structure.
  2. There are two files that can be used for running the simulation: 'RUN.ipynb' for jupyter notebook and 'executable.py' for python IDEs
  3. Open the notebook 'RUN.ipynb'
  4. Run the first cell in 'RUN.ipynb' if you want to store the output in a .txt file OR run the 4th cell if you want to change the parameters of the simulation
  5. If change in parameters is desired, change only the 'flux' value in cell 4, line 6.
